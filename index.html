          <p class="char-info-title-description">
            A fierce warrior of primitive background who can enter a battle
            rage.
          </p>
          <p class="char-info-description barbarian-description">
            A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and
            hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who
            dared poach his people’s elk herd.<br /><br />
            A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over
            their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as
            she did to the last six rivals.<br /><br />
            Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his
            drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of
            another.<br /><br />
            These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their
            rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere
            emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the
            unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.<br /><br />
            For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal
            spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world
            full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not
            just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and
            feats of strength.<br /><br />

            Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the
            fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to
            smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.<br /><br />
            Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a
            leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction
            of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the
            cultists’ activities.<br /><br />
            Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass
            of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the
            foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.<br /><br />
            Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the
            creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s
            resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature.
            Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable
            will.

            A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she

            leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his
            exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two
            combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.<br /><br />
            A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club
            and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a
            half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as
            she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.<br /><br />
            A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident
            and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the
            crowd’s delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword
            flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning
            flashing forth to smite him.<br /><br />
            All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of
            characters in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Questing knights,
            conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened
            mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an
            unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough
            knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with
            death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

            dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving
            stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and
            rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are
            particularly useful against their specific favored foes.<br /><br />
            Thanks to their familiarity with wilds, rangers acquire the ability
            to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does.
            Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth,
            and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly
            focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.

            saga it depicts.<br /><br />
            A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale
            mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his

            Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through

            axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against

            Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a

            knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last
            she stands alone.<br /><br />
            Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a
            battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and
            a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.<br /><br />
            Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps
            into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow

            Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to

            A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him
            nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band
            celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst
            and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize
            he is there.<br /><br />
            Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate

            Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by
            their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn
            before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade
            before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation
            and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a
            powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior
            into a blessed champion.

            comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat

            Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically
