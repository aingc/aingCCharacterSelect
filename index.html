            A warrior who combats threats on<br />
            the edges of civilization.

          <p class="char-info-description ranger-description">
            Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the
            monsters that threaten the edges of civilization-humanoid raiders,
            rampaging beasts and monstronsities, terrible giants, and deadly
            dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving
            stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and
            rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are
            particularly useful against their specific favored foes.<br /><br />
            Thanks to their familiarity with wilds, rangers acquire the ability
            to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does.
            Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth,
            and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly
            focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.

            Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the
            fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to
            smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.<br /><br />
            Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a
            leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction
            of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the
            cultists’ activities.<br /><br />
            Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass
            of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the
            foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.<br /><br />
            Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the
            creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s
            resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature.
            Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable
            will.

            A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she
            runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded
            leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his
            exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two
            combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.<br /><br />
            A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club
            and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a
            half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as
            she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.<br /><br />
            A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident
            and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the
            crowd’s delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword
            flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning
            flashing forth to smite him.<br /><br />
            All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of
            characters in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Questing knights,
            conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened
            mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an
            unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough
            knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with
            death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.
